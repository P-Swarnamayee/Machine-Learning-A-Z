Three steps:
--------------
  1. Data preprocessing: Import data --> clean data --> split into train and test sets
  2. Data modelling: Build model --> train model --> make predictions
  3. Model Evaluation: Calculate performance metrics --> Make a verdict

Training and Testing Sets:
Suppose you want to sell a car and want to predict the price of car
Dependent variable --> price of car
Independent variable --> mileage, age of car
Total no.of cars you have in the dataset --> 20

Spliting the data=> 20% of data separated as testing set
                 => 80% of data separated as training set
Training set --> used to build a model
Then we take the cars from test set and apply our model to them and predict the value --> predicted value
We also have actual value of car price that we know from training set --> actual value

So, now we compare the predicted value with the actual value and we can estimate the accuracy of our model and check if our model needs any improvement

Feature Scaling: (Always applied to columns)
---------------------------------------------
There are many techniques but we have 2 main ones
  1. Normalization
  2. Standatdization

1. Normalization: We produce a new column by adjust the values in the column between [0,1]
                  Formula:  X' = (X - Xmin)/(Xmax - Xmin)

2. Standardization: It is same as normalization, but instead of subtracting the min from every value, 
                    we subtract the average and divide by standard deviation and produce a new column whose 
                    values are betweem [-3,+3]
                  Formula:  X' = (X - Xavg)/(StandardDeviation)

Suppose we have the following data:
person    annual_salary    age    (After normalization)  person    annual_salary    age
p1        $70000            45                              p1         1             1 
p2        $60000            44                              p2         0.44          0.8
p3        $52000            40                              p3         0             0

Based on the normalized data, we can see that p2 is between p1 and p2 in terms of annual_salary,
but he is closer to p1 in terms of age.
